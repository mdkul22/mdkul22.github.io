# Introduction

This website aims to blog the recent projects that I have been working on. Also includes some rants and such. 
I am an embedded systems programmer interested in various topics mainly building custom firmware for various 
sensing boards. I have been recently getting into open source split keyboards. This website will mostly discuss
my journey into these projects.
